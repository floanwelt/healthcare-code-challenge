 UI - Unique Identifier (UID)

 # Definition
 A character string containing a UID that is used to uniquely identify a wide variety of items.
 The UID is a series of numeric components separated by the period "." character.
 If a Value Field containing one or more UIDs is an odd number of bytes in length, the Value Field shall be padded
 with a single trailing NULL (00H) character to ensure that the Value Field is an even number of bytes in length.
 See Section 9 and Annex B for a complete specification and examples.

 # Character Reportoire
 "0"-"9", "." of Default Character Repertoire

 # Length of value
 64 bytes maximum
